# Light Client Module Specification

## Abstract

A light client has all the security of a full node with minimal bandwidth requirements. The minimal 
bandwidth requirements allows developers to build fully secure, efficient and usable mobile apps,
websites or any other application that does not want to download and follow the full blockchain.

LCD will be used in the Cosmos Hub, the first Hub in the Cosmos network.
